This project presents some of the neural network architectures
commonly used in semantic segmentation applications, compares their
performance and evaluates them against the state-of-the-art solutions.  

Moreover, the project introduces a methodology of using freely available tools, aiming to help researchers with limited computational resources implement machine learning applications.

The following networks were trained and then used for semantic segmentation:

* FCN-32 with ResNet18 backbone network
* FCN-32 with ResNet50 backbone network
* FCN-16 with VGG backbone network
* FCN-8 with VGG backbone network
* SegNet

In the following images we can see an example of an original image, along with the segmentation achieved used the above networks.
